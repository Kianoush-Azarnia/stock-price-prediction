Forecasting stock prices has always been one of the most attractive 
problems in the field of finance and investment.

### Goal
The purpose of this project is to compare and test the accuracy and 
efficiency of statistical forecasting models as well as machine learning based 
models in stock price forecasting. 

### Method
The method used was to use the daily stock price history of the Tehran Stock 
Exchange to predict stock prices. We use both Machine Learning & Statistics based algorithms for time series forecasting.

### Algorithms 
1. Statistical:
    * exponential smoothing
    * linear regression
    * multivariate regression

2. Machine Learning based:
    * random forest
    * gradient boost
    * feed-forward neural network

### Tools

* R
* ShinyApp
* Forecast package
* H2O.ai

### Run
The main code of shiny application is located in
 [here](https://github.com/Kianoush-Azarnia/stock-price-prediction/tree/master/deployShinyApp)
 
You can run it in RStudio with `shiny::runApp()` command.
